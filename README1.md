****My Recommendations**** <br>
After spending considerable time with various resources, I've found that the most straightforward and effective path to certification is often overlooked. While I initially invested time in popular Udemy courses by Marek/Kane, I discovered that the rush to create content for beta exam takers resulted in somewhat fragmented material. Although these courses have since been updated, they still feel like they're catching up.
Key Learning: I passed the exam, but in retrospect, I realize I could have had an easier journey by focusing primarily on two resources:<br>
1.	AWS Skill Builder courses<br>
2.	AWS Developer Guides (DGs)<br>
This realization came after the beta window, but it's a valuable lesson for future cert seekers. While third-party courses aren't bad, they often try to compensate for gaps that don't exist in AWS's own materials.<br>

**Below are my recommendations**:<br>
1.	AWS Skill Builder (Primary Resource) – The best (and could be only one you need)<br>
2.	Hands-on Experience (at least SageMaker, Bedrock)<br>
3.	Other AWS Documentation/Preparation materials <br>
    o	SageMaker Developer Guide (This is huge, find my curated notes from the guide below)<br>
    o	SageMaker Deep Dive (YouTube Series – Bit outdated but still very helpful)<br>
    o	AI Practitioner material revision (See my notes below)<br>

**Others Prep options to consider** <br>
  o	Tutorial Dojo: Ran out of time to practice prior to test, but I reviewed them afterwards and found them helpful.  <br>
  o	Whizlabs: Ran out of time and haven't reviewed them <br>
  o	Marek Practice test: Ran out of time and haven't reviewed them<br>

******My Resources******
•	AWS AI Practitioner Notes
•	Other AWS AI Services FAQs
•	SageMaker Guide (Curated SageMaker DG notes)
•	SageMaker FAQs
•	AWS Skill builder Notes (It should be Comprehensive by itself)
